ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Divya Rajput!
I'm a graduate student @University of Southern California majoring in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for AI, ML, and deep learning technologies. Currently exploring AI/ML opportunities, I have experience in building and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP, and AI-powered solutions. I'm skilled in frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, and I love working on projects that combine cutting-edge research with real-world impact.
